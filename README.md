### Examples of how to implement Quasi/Natural experiment approaches using Python 

I tried to give you examples and possible libraries which might be helpful to conduct DinD and Instumental variable approaches, the most common ones of Quasi experiment. 
I can't find detailed explanation of these methods from following readme files and python files. Because I am assuming that you have already know how to do it in other softwares such as STATA, EVIEWS, and SAS. 

If u are interested in the methodology and learn about it, I would recommend you three books in reference to read.
